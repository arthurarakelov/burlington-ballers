# Firebase Integration Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Code Organization & Architecture
- **Refactored monolithic App.js** into focused, reusable components
- **Clean folder structure**: `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `utils/`, `constants/`
- **Separated concerns**: Auth, games, UI components each have their own files
- **Custom hooks**: `useAuth`, `useMouseTracking` for state management
- **Utility functions**: Date formatting, location constants

### 2. Firebase Backend Integration
- **Firebase SDK v12.1.0** installed and configured
- **Environment variables** set up with your project credentials
- **Google Authentication** with popup/redirect fallback
- **Firestore real-time database** for games and RSVPs
- **Security**: User data stored securely with proper authentication

### 3. Enhanced RSVP System
- **"Can't Make It" functionality** - users can decline games
- **Three RSVP states**: Not responded, Attending, Declined
- **Status changes**: Users can change their mind between attending/declined
- **Visual distinction**: Declined users shown in red with separate section
- **Real-time updates**: All changes sync immediately across users

### 4. Firebase Collections & Data Model

```javascript
// Collections in Firestore:
users: {
  uid: string,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  photo: string,
  lastLogin: timestamp
}

games: {
  id: string,
  title: string,
  location: string,
  address: string,
  date: string,
  time: string,
  organizerUid: string,
  organizerName: string,
  organizerPhoto: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  weather: object
}

rsvps: {
  id: string,
  gameId: string,
  userUid: string,
  userName: string,
  userPhoto: string,
  status: 'attending' | 'declined',
  arrivalTime?: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## 🚀 New Features Available

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow:
1. `useAuth` hook manages Google sign-in state
2. Popup sign-in with redirect fallback for mobile
3. Automatic user document creation in Firestore
4. Persistent login state across sessions

### Real-time Data:
1. `gameService.subscribeToGames()` for live updates
2. Automatic RSVP aggregation (attending vs declined)
3. Real-time UI updates when data changes
4. Optimistic loading states

### Error Handling:
1. Authentication errors displayed to user
2. Network errors gracefully handled
